        <h1>Existentialism of Quantum Physics</h1>
        <p>
          Quantum Physics describe the fundamental rules of the universe that
          enable the mechanisms for the entire universe, range from atoms to
          galaxies, to exist and even for you to read these words. EQP was
          created with two aims: 1. To teach anyone about quantum physics, the
          building blocks of our universe, and to get more students interested
          in the field. 2. To test a simulation theory concept - if we can
          simulate the fundamental rules of the universe, we will be able to
          simulate anything in the universe using software. Simulation theory
          brings up many philosophical and ethical conundrums, including
          whether we are currently in a simulation and if we could ever know.
          Building a virtual “reality” if perfectly model the standard model
          then increase in size to the earth then essentially created exactly
          what is us
